Tutorial application live-coded at Ruby on Rails workshops by Karel Minarik (karmi@karmi.cz).

Basically a clone of classic TadaList (http://www.tadalist.com/), offering similar functionality:

* Managing tasks
* Grouping tasks into projects (Project has_many :tasks )
* Ajax interactivity for toggling state of tasks
* Atom feed for recently completed tasks
* Contains basic functional and unit tests

Application is constructed in small steps from blank, generated Rails application, every step is commited into Git.

Check diffs for the important steps in Git tags.


See http://www.karmi.cz/#ruby-on-rails-workshops for information about the workshops (in Czech).
